            <p>
              We published a Draft EIS under the State Environmental Policy Act in 2021 that evaluated three possible
              sites for the OMF South facility. After a public comment period (<a
                href="https://www.soundtransit.org/sites/default/files/documents/operations-and-maintenance-facility-south-public-engagement-summary-20211110.pdf"
                target="_blank">engagement summary</a>,
              <a href="https://www.soundtransit.org/sites/default/files/documents/operations-and-maintenance-facility-south-deis-comment-summary-report-20211110.pdf"
                target="_blank">comment summary</a>), the Sound Transit Board identified the South 336th Street site in
              Federal Way as the preferred alternative in December 2021. To align federal and state processes, we are
              now publishing a National Environmental Policy Act Draft/SEPA Supplemental Draft EIS (Draft EIS) that
              evaluates these same alternatives. Based on its transit expertise and greater federal funding
              opportunities, the Federal Transit Administration will be the lead agency. A joint NEPA/SEPA Final EIS
              will follow in 2024.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                All public comments provided on the SEPA Draft EIS in 2021 are valid and do not need to be resubmitted.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will respond to all substantive comments from both comment periods in the Final EIS.
              </li>
              <li>
                After the Final EIS is published, the Sound Transit Board will select the project to be built.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Sound Transit is working toward an opening in 2032 but is also pursuing measures to advance the opening earlier (potentially 2029). If the Midway Landfill alternative is selected as the project to be built, the opening date would be between 2035 and 2037 depending on the subsurface construction design option. We
              will
              share an updated project schedule when we have more certainty.
            </p>
            <h4>
              What has changed since the SEPA Draft EIS was published in 2021?
            </h4>
            <p>
              We’ve continued the project’s design and engineering work since the 2021 publication of the SEPA Draft
              EIS. We’ve evaluated the potential environmental impacts of several design refinements, in the Draft EIS
              which include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>The addition of a test track and associated access road</b> to the proposed site layouts for South
                336th Street preferred alternative and South 344th Street alternatives. The test track would help us
                prepare new and existing light rail vehicles for service. The Midway Landfill alternative would not
                include a test track.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Updates to the South 336th Street preferred alternative site layout</b> in close coordination with
                the City of Federal Way.
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The main site entrance has been moved from SR 99 to South 340th Street.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The site has been expanded to the southwest to provide more space for buildings and yard area.
                </li>
                <li>18th Place Southwest has been extended to replace the functionality of 20th Avenue South. The 18th Place South extension would also include a multi-use path.
                </li>
                <li>
                  21st Avenue South has been extended to connect to South 344th Street.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Road widening has been incorporated on the south side of South 336th Street to meet city requirements.
                </li><li>
                  Existing culverts that carry the West Fork Hylebos Creek Tributary under South 336th Street and the East Fork Hylebos Creek Tributary under South 344th Street are planned to be upgraded, removed, and/or relocated to meet state fish passage requirements.
                </li><li>
                  The site and internal track configuration has been modified to allow for a wider stream and wetland corridor on the east side of the OMF, between the site and I-5.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </ul>

                An OMF is where Link light rail trains go for cleaning, storage
                and maintenance, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Sound Transit
                needs four strategically located OMF facilities. We need this new
                OMF in the South Sound to receive, store and service a larger
                train fleet to support future light rail extensions to Tacoma and
                throughout the region. To build this new facility, we need
                approximately 60-70 acres (for reference, one football field is
                1.3 acres) near the

              <p><b>November 2016: Voter approval</b></p>
              <p>Voters approved 118 miles of Link light rail, including two new OMFs—one in the north corridor and
                another in the South Sound—to serve the growing light rail system.</p>
              <p><b>Mid to late 2018: Initial community idea gathering and evaluation</b></p>
              <p>After receiving community input during the early scoping outreach period in April 2018, Sound Transit
                identified 24 potential OMF South sites for further analysis. After initial screening, we reduced the
                number of potential sites to 20. We assessed these 20 sites with a robust list of evaluation criteria,
                including project schedule, long-term facility planning, operational requirements, environmental
                impacts, and engineering risks, among others. </p>
              <p><b>February to April 2019: SEPA Scoping</b></p>
              <p>Based on the results of the detailed screening, Sound Transit recommended six sites in Kent and Federal
                Way for further consideration. The public had the opportunity to share their thoughts on the six
                potential sites, as well as the OMF South project Purpose and Need Statement and environmental resources
                to evaluate in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement, during the scoping comment period under the

              <ul>
                <li>Midway Landfill alternative</li>
                <li>South 336th Street alternative</li>
                <li>South 344th Street alternative</li>
              </ul>
              <p><b>Summer 2019 to 2021: SEPA Draft EIS</b></p>
              <p>Sound Transit prepared a Draft EIS under SEPA to share findings with tribes, agency and jurisdictional
                partners, social service and cultural organizations, and the public. We published the SEPA Draft EIS in
                2021 and held a public comment period (<a

              <p><b>December 2021: Sound Transit Board identified a preferred alternative</b></p>
              <p>After the SEPA Draft EIS comment period, the Sound Transit Board considered the SEPA Draft EIS analysis
                and comments received and then identified the South 336th Street site in Federal Way as the preferred
                alternative, with all three sites still to be evaluated in a Final EIS.</p>
              <p><b>December 2021 to July 2023: Project refinements</b></p>
              <p>After the Sound Transit Board identified the South 336th Street site in Federal Way as the preferred
                alternative, we completed additional fieldwork activities and environmental analysis.
                Additional site refinements were made to the preferred and South 334th Street alternatives.</p>
              <p><b>July to August 2023: NEPA Scoping</b></p>
              <p>After the Federal Transit Administration became the lead agency for the OMF South project, both the
                Federal Transit Administration and Sound Transit held a scoping comment period under NEPA
                for comments in addition to those received during SEPA scoping.</p>
              <p><b>We are here: Draft EIS</b></p>
              <p>To align the federal and state processes, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and Sound Transit
                have
                published a NEPA Draft/SEPA Supplemental Draft EIS that evaluates the same three alternatives as the
                2021 SEPA Draft EIS. FTA is the lead
                agency under NEPA and Sound Transit is the lead agency under SEPA. This additional review is to support
                federal approvals, federal funding and assess project design changes. The findings from the EIS are
                being
                shared with Tribes, agency and jurisdictional partners, and the public through a 45-day public comment
                period. All public comments provided on the SEPA Draft EIS in 2021 remain valid and do not need to be
                resubmitted. After receiving and considering public comments, FTA and Sound Transit will complete a
                joint Final EIS before the Sound Transit Board selects the project to be built.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-5">What is an Environmental Impact Statement?</h3>

      <p>
        Before Sound Transit builds projects, we study the potential effects each project alternative may have on the
        natural and built environment in a document called an Environmental Impact Statement. The EIS helps decision
        makers, the public and our project partners evaluate the possible environmental impacts of each potential site
        during construction and operation. The EIS also compares the effects of each alternative to inform the public,
        agencies and the Sound Transit Board.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the
        <a href="https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/documents-reports/operations-maintenance-facility-south-draft-environmental-impact"
          target="_blank">OMF South Draft EIS</a>, we looked at how the Midway Landfill, South 344th Street and South
        336th Street alternatives would affect air and water quality, historical and cultural resources, property
        acquisition and land use, economic effects, hazardous materials, ecosystem resources, cost, schedule and more.
        In December 2021, the Sound Transit Board identified the South 336th Street alternative as the preferred
        alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we’re combining our state (SEPA) and federal (NEPA) environmental review processes. We’ve published a Draft
        EIS that evaluates these same alternatives. A Final EIS will follow in 2024.
      </p>
      <h4>What potential environmental effects are different from the 2021 SEPA Draft EIS? </h4>
      <p>Since the 2021 SEPA Draft EIS, we've updated the analysis for all three alternatives. Here
        are some key updates.</p>
      <p><b>Increased residential displacements for Federal Way sites (preferred alternative and South 344th Street)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Since the 2021 SEPA Draft EIS publication, residential displacements have increased by 18-24 due to the
          advancement of design and construction information and the increased site size. The additional displacements
          are primarily along the northern portion of the guideway that connects the preferred and South 344th Street
          alternatives to the OMF site.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Other notable changes to potential effects from the preferred alternative</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The amount of long-term impacts to ecosystem resources, including streams, wetlands, and mature forest,
          decreased. However, the amount of long-term impacts to wetland buffers increased. These changes are due to
          refinements to the site design.</li>
        <li>Due to the site expansion, there was in increase in business and
          employee displacements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Other notable potential effects</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cost estimates have been updated to 2023 dollars and incorporate design refinements. Cost estimates are for
          comparative purposes and do not represent the project budget.</li>
        <li>For the 344th Street alternative, business and employee displacements decreased due to shortening the tail
          track.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Why should I comment on the Draft EIS?</h4>
      <div style="background-color: #FFB819;" class="px-2">
        <p class="py-1"><b>All comments that were provided on the SEPA Draft EIS in 2021 remain valid and do not need to
            be resubmitted. We will respond to all substantive comments from both comment periods in the Final EIS.</b>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>During this Draft EIS comment
        period through Nov. 6, you can provide feedback on the alternatives, EIS analysis, and summary of scoping
        comments. SEPA Draft EIS comments from 2021 remain valid and do not need to be resubmitted; however, if you’d
        like to comment again,
        focus your comments on the project changes and updated analysis. After the comment period, we’ll then prepare a
        Final EIS, which will evaluate the
        preferred and other alternatives, and include responses to all substantive comments received on the Draft EIS.
        We expect to publish the Final EIS in 2024, then the Board will select the project to be built. Why comment?
        Comments from Tribes, the public and agency partners inform the Board in their decision-making.</p>

        Questions about your property?

        <p>
          Did you receive a property owner letter or think the project may affect your property? A notification of

          possibility we would need to acquire your property in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Final decisions on affected properties and acquisitions generally won’t occur until after the Final EIS and
          the Sound
          Transit Board selects the project to be built. In some limited cases, Sound Transit purchases properties prior
          to the Board's action. If we determine that your property is needed for OMF South, Sound Transit will initiate
          official
          conversations around acquisitions and relocation at that time and after an independent appraisal process.

              On Dec. 16, 2021, the Sound Transit Board identified the South
              336th Street alternative in Federal Way as the preferred alternative for OMF South.
            </p>
            <h4>Key features</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The preferred alternative is in Federal Way, between South
                336th Street and South 341st Place, and between I-5 and SR 99.
              </li>
              <li>The site footprint is approximately 66 acres.</li>
              <li>
                The preferred alternative includes about 1.4 miles of
                <a href="#fedWayAcc-1" class="acc-anchor">
                  mainline
                  light rail tracks<sup>🛈</sup>
                </a>. These tracks would also be needed for the Tacoma Dome Link Extension
                light rail alignment.
              </li>
              <li>
                The preferred alternative also includes a test track to
                prepare new vehicles for service. The test track would run
                parallel and on the east side of the connecting light rail
                tracks.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <h4>EIS comparison</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In terms of amount of time to build and operate, time to
              construct, and local traffic congestion during construction,
              the preferred alternative impacts would be substantially fewer
              than the Midway Landfill alternative and like the other
              Federal Way site (South 344th Street alternative).
            </li>
            <li>
              The preferred alternative would have the second-highest
              residential, business, employee and community and social
              resource displacements.
            </li>
            <li>
              The preferred alternative would cause greater impacts than the
              other alternatives to wetlands, forest, and streams, which
              would require mitigation.

                  Before a new light rail vehicle can start carrying passengers,
                  we need to test how it performs on the track.
                  Since we have light rail service running on the mainline track during most of the day,
                  we currently do all vehicle testing during the short service window from 1-5 a.m.
                  Building a test track will allow us to test vehicles more quickly to get them ready
                  for service—and we have a lot more cars coming online as we expand the regional light rail system!

                <sup>🛈</sup>How do you build on a landfill?

              <div class="panel">
                <p>
                  Building on top of a landfill is a unique and complex
                  challenge. Sound Transit must address the likelihood that
                  this ground will continue shifting and settling over time,
                  which could affect the tracks, equipment and other
                  infrastructure. To prevent settlement, Sound Transit is
                  considering three methods to prepare the Midway Landfill
                  site for possible OMF construction: Platform, Hybrid and
                  Full Excavation. Due to contaminated material, material
                  removed from the Midway Landfill during construction would
                  require disposal at another landfill facility equipped to
                  accept contaminated waste. The material would be hauled by
                  truck to a regional transfer facility and sent on by rail
                  for disposal.
                </p>
                <h4>Platform</h4>
                <p><em>Construct an approximately 3.5-foot thick, 35-acre concrete platform on top of a new landfill cap
                    to support the facility. The platform option would require removing some of the landfill and
                    drilling approximately 700 concrete support shafts roughly 120-180 feet deep.</em></p>

            <h3>Tips to guide your feedback</h3>
            <p>
              If you already submitted comments as part of the 2021 environmental review process, those comments are
              valid and you won’t need to resubmit them. We welcome any comments that are new or different on the
              alternatives and
              technical analysis in the Draft EIS! We’ll respond to substantive comments received in 2021 and during
              this comment period in the Final EIS. The Sound Transit Board will consider comments when the select the project to be built
            </p>
            <p>You can make any comment you would like but here are some examples to guide your feedback:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Questions or comments on the technical analysis in the Draft EIS</li>
              <li>What do you think about the possible impacts, benefits and mitigation for impacts our analysis
                identified for any of the three sites (preferred alternative, South 344th Street, Midway Landfill)?</li>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>After the Draft EIS comment period is over, we’ll compile a summary of all the comments we received, and
              we’ll make it available on the Sound Transit website.</p>

              After the NEPA Draft/SEPA Supplemental Draft EIS comment period closes on Nov. 6, 2023, comments will be
              compiled and evaluated, and a
              summary of your comments will be provided to the Sound Transit Board. Comments will be made
              available to the public at that time. The Final EIS, which will include responses to substantive Draft EIS comments and evaluation of the preferred and other alternatives, is anticipated to be issued. After that,
              the Board will select a project to be built in mid to late 2024, and the Federal Transit Administration is
              anticipated to issue a Record of Decision under NEPA.
