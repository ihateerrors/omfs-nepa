            <p>
              We published a Draft EIS under the State Environmental Policy Act in 2021 that evaluated three possible sites for the OMF South facility. After a public comment period (<a
              href="https://www.soundtransit.org/sites/default/files/documents/operations-and-maintenance-facility-south-public-engagement-summary-20211110.pdf"

            <a href="https://www.soundtransit.org/sites/default/files/documents/operations-and-maintenance-facility-south-deis-comment-summary-report-20211110.pdf"
              target="_blank">comment summary</a>), the Sound Transit Board identified the South 336th Street site in Federal Way as the preferred alternative in December 2021. To align federal and state processes, we are now publishing a National Environmental Policy Act Draft/SEPA Supplemental Draft EIS (Draft EIS) that evaluates these same alternatives. Based on its transit expertise and greater federal funding opportunities, the Federal Transportation Administration will be the lead agency. A joint NEPA/SEPA Final EIS will follow in 2024.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                All public comments provided on the SEPA Draft EIS in 2021 are valid and do not need to be resubmitted.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will respond to all substantive comments from both comment periods in the Final EIS.
              </li>
              <li>
                After the Final EIS is published, the Sound Transit Board will select a project to be built.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Given that FTA is now the lead agency for the project, Sound Transit is evaluating any potential adjustments to the project schedule. We are working to stay close to our planned opening date of 2029; however, the opening date could be as late as 2032. We will share an updated project schedule when we have more certainty.
            </p>
            <h4>
              What has changed since the SEPA Draft EIS was published in 2021? 
            </h4>
            <p>
              We’ve continued the project’s design and engineering work since the 2021 publication of the SEPA Draft EIS. We’ve evaluated the potential environmental impacts of several design refinements, in the Draft EIS which include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>The addition of a test track and associated access road</b> to the proposed site layouts for South 336th Street preferred alternative and South 344th Street alternatives. The test track would help us prepare new and existing light rail vehicles for service. The Midway Landfill alternative would not include a test track.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Updates to the South 336th Street preferred alternative site layout</b> in close coordination with the City of Federal Way. Changes include replacing the functionality of 20th Avenue South, which would be removed to make space for the OMF South facility, by extending 18th Place South between South 340th and 336th streets. (Our earlier site design did not include a replacement street for 20th Avenue South.)
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The 18th Place South extension would also include a multi-use path.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the Sound Transit Board selects the preferred alternative as the site of the project to be built, Sound Transit would submit a street vacation application to the Federal Way City Council to include these street changes as part of construction for OMF South. We’ll share more information later this year about this process.
                </li>
                <li>Updates to the preferred alternative site layout include five additional light industrial/commercial property displacements.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            </ul>

                An OMF is where Link light rail trains go for cleaning, storage
                and maintenance, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Sound Transit
                needs four strategically located OMF facilities. We need this new
                OMF in the South Sound to receive, store and service a larger
                train fleet to support future light rail extensions to Tacoma and
                throughout the region. To build this new facility, we need
                approximately 60-70 acres (for reference, one football field is
                1.3 acres) near the

              <p><b>November 2016: Voter approval</b></p>
              <p>Voters approved 118 miles of Link light rail, including two new OMFs—one in the north corridor and another in the South Sound—to serve the growing light rail system.</p>
              <p><b>Mid to late 2018: Initial community idea gathering and evaluation</b></p>
              <p>After receiving community input during the early scoping outreach period in April 2018, Sound Transit created layouts for 24 potential OMF South site options identified for further analysis. After initial screening, we reduced the number of potential sites to 20. We assessed these 20 sites with a robust list of evaluation criteria, including project schedule, long-term facility planning, operational requirements, environmental impacts, and engineering risks, among others. </p>
              <p><b>February to April 2019: SEPA Scoping</b></p>
              <p>Based on the results of the detailed screening, Sound Transit recommended six sites in Kent and Federal Way for further consideration. The public had the opportunity to share their thoughts on the six potential sites, as well as the OMF South project Purpose and Need Statement and environmental resources to evaluate in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement, during the scoping comment period under the State Environmental Policy Act.</p>
              <p><b>May 2019: Sound Transit Board decision</b></p>
              <p>After reviewing community feedback gathered during scoping and the thorough evaluation on the six potential sites, the Sound Transit Board decided that three sites should be studied further in the Draft EIS:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Midway Landfill alternative</li>
                <li>South 336th Street alternative</li>
                <li>South 344th Street alternative</li>
              </ul>
              <p><b>Summer 2019 to 2021: SEPA Draft EIS</b></p>
              <p>Sound Transit worked to prepare a Draft EIS under SEPA to share findings with tribes, agency and jurisdictional partners, social service and cultural organizations, and you. We published the SEPA Draft EIS in 2021 and held a public comment period (<a

              </p>
              <p><b>December 2021: Sound Transit Board identified a preferred alternative</b></p>
              <p>After the SEPA Draft EIS comment period, the Sound Transit Board identified the South 336th Street site in Federal Way as the preferred alternative, with all three sites still to be evaluated in a Final EIS. A “preferred alternative” is a statement of where the agency is leaning based on information available at the time. It’s not a final decision.</p>
              <p><b>December 2021 to July 2023: Project refinements</b></p>
              <p>After the Sound Transit Board selected the South 336th Street site in Federal Way as the preferred alternative, we completed additional fieldwork activities and environmental analysis for all sites. Additional site refinements were made to the preferred alternative and South 334th Street sites.</p>
              <p><b>July to August 2023: NEPA Scoping</b></p>
              <p>After the Federal Transit Administration became the lead agency for the OMF South project, both the Federal Transit Administration and Sound Transit held a scoping comment period in compliance with NEPA for comments in addition to those received during SEPA scoping.</p>
              <p><b>We are here: Draft EIS</b></p>
              <p>To align the federal and state processes, Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and Sound Transit have published a Draft EIS that evaluates the same three alternatives as the SEPA Draft EIS. FTA is the lead agency under NEPA and Sound Transit is the lead agency under SEPA. The findings from the EIS are being shared with tribes, agency and jurisdictional partners, and the public through a 45-day public comment period. All public comments provided on the SEPA Draft EIS in 2021 remain valid and do not need to be resubmitted. After receiving and considering public comments, FTA and Sound Transit will complete a joint Final EIS before the Sound Transit Board selects the project to be built.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-5">What is an Environmental Impact Statement?</h3>
      
      <p>
        Before Sound Transit builds projects, we study the potential effects each project alternative may have on the natural and built environment in a document called an Environmental Impact Statement. The EIS helps Sound Transit, the public and our project partners evaluate the possible environmental impacts of each potential site during construction and operation. The EIS also compares the effects of each alternative to inform the public, agencies and the Sound Transit Board. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In the
        <a href="https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/documents-reports/operations-maintenance-facility-south-draft-environmental-impact"
          target="_blank">OMF South Draft EIS</a> we looked at how the Midway Landfill, South 344th Street and South 336th Street site alternatives would affect air and water quality, historical and cultural resources, property acquisition and land use, economic effects, hazardous materials, ecosystem resources, cost, schedule and more. In December 2021, the Sound Transit Board identified the South 336th Street site as the preferred alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we’re combining our state (SEPA) and federal (NEPA) environmental review processes. We’ve published a Draft EIS that evaluates these same alternatives. A Final EIS will follow in 2024.
      </p>
      <h4>What potential environmental effects are different from the 2021 SEPA Draft EIS? </h4>
      <p>All three sites have changes in total potential effects. Since the preferred alternative has had the most design refinements, it also has the most changes in potential effects compared to the 2021 SEPA Draft EIS. Here are some notable updates.</p>
      <p><b>Increased residential displacements for Federal Way sites (preferred alternative and South 344th Street)</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Since the SEPA Draft EIS publication, the number of residential displacements reported in the earlier environmental analysis has increased by 18-24 displacements, depending on the alignment curve selected in this area. Originally, we assumed that many of the homes would not be affected; however, as the design and construction techniques were advanced, it became clear that the homes needed to be removed.</li>
        <li>We determined one more expected residential displacement due to expansion to the south of the preferred alternative site footprint.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Other notable changes to potential effects from the preferred alternative</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>We determined decreased potential effects to ecosystem resources including streams, wetland buffers, and forests. We also analyzed an increased risk on potential effects to permanent wetlands. These changes are due to changes in the site design.</li>
        <li>Site expansion, as a result of design refinements, is also responsible for increases in business and employee displacements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Other notable potential effects</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cost estimates have been updated to 2023 dollars and incorporate design refinements. Cost estimates are for comparative purposes and do not represent the project budget.</li>
        <li>For the 344th Street alternative, business and employee displacements decreased due to shortening the tail track.</li>
        <li>The Midway Landfill alternative had a decrease in employee displacements due to a change in business type.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Why should I comment on the Draft EIS?</h4>
      <p class="bg-warning"><b>All comments that were provided on the SEPA Draft EIS in 2021 remain valid and do not need to be resubmitted. We will respond to all substantive comments from both comment periods in the Final EIS.</b></p>
      <p>The OMF South is currently in the Draft EIS phase, which will have a formal comment period. During this comment period, conducted under NEPA and SEPA through November 6, the public can provide feedback on the environmental findings for each site. SEPA Draft EIS comments from 2021 remain valid; however, if you’d like to comment again, focus your comments on the new environmental analysis. We’ll then prepare a Final EIS, which will evaluate the preferred and other alternatives, and include responses to all substantive comments received on the Draft EIS. We expect to publish the Final EIS in 2024, then the Board will select the project to be built. Why comment? Comments from Tribes, the public and agency partners inform the Board in their decision-making.</p>

          Did you receive a property owner letter or think the project may affect your property? A notification of potential impact does not mean a decision has been made to purchase your property, but it does mean there’s a possibility we would need to acquire your property in the future.

          Final decisions on affected properties and acquisitions won’t occur until after the Final EIS and Sound Transit Board decision. In some special cases, Sound Transit purchases properties before the Final EIS' publication. If we determine that your property is needed for OMF South, Sound Transit will initiate official conversations around acquisitions and relocation at that time and after an independent appraisal process.

          <p>
            On Dec. 16, 2021, the Sound Transit Board identified the South
            336th Street site in Federal Way as the preferred alternative
            for the location for OMF South. A preferred alternative is a
            description of the project that the agency is leaning based on
            information available at the time. It’s not a final decision.
          </p>
          <h4>Key features</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The preferred alternative is in Federal Way, between South
              336th Street and South 341st Place, and between I-5 and SR 99.
            </li>
            <li>The site footprint is approximately 65 acres.</li>
            <li>
              The preferred alternative would affect the built and natural
              environment (such as residential displacements and wetland and
              stream impacts) from the site and from 1.4 miles of connecting
              light rail tracks<sup>🛈</sup>. Sound Transit expects to
              construct these tracks for the Tacoma Dome Link Extension
              light rail alignment regardless of whether this site is
              selected for OMF South.
            </li>
            <li>
              The preferred alternative also includes a test track to
              prepare new vehicles for service. The test track would run
              parallel and on the east side of the connecting light rail
              tracks.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>EIS comparison</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In terms of amount of time to build and operate, time to
              construct, and local traffic congestion during construction,
              the preferred alternative impacts would be substantially fewer
              than the Midway Landfill alternative and like the other
              Federal Way site (South 344th Street alternative).
            </li>
            <li>
              The preferred alternative would have the second-highest
              residential, business, employee and community and social
              resource displacements.
            </li>
            <li>
              The preferred alternative would cause greater impacts than the
              other alternatives to wetlands, forest, and streams, which
              would require mitigation.
            </li>
          </ul>

              <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    We would need to construct 1.4-1.8 miles of additional track (also called “mainline” track) 
                    between the end of the Federal Way Link Extension (currently in construction) to the potential 
                    OMF sites in Federal Way—the preferred alternative at South 336th Street and the 
                    South 344th Street alternative—to transport light rail cars from the regional system to the OMF South. 
                    We’re also studying this track in the environmental review for the <a href="https://tdlink.participate.online/">Tacoma Dome Link Extension</a> as part of the route.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the Midway Landfill alternative is selected as the project to be built, these tracks in Federal Way will be built as part of TDLE.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Midway Landfill site is next to the Federal Way Link Extension route, 
                    so aside from short connecting tracks to the facility (also called “lead” tracks), 
                    there would be no added light rail track needed for that alternative.

                    Before a new light rail vehicle can start carrying passengers, 
                    we need to test how it performs on the track. 
                    Since we have light rail service running on the mainline track during most of the day, 
                    we currently do all vehicle testing during the short service window from 1-5 a.m. 
                    Building a test track will allow us to test vehicles more quickly to get them ready 
                    for service—and we have a lot more cars coming online as we expand the regional light rail system! 
                    After analyzing the most suitable location for a test track in our system, 
                    we found that putting it near OMF South was the best fit technically and operationally.

            <li>The South 344th Street alternative is in Federal Way, between South 336th Street and South 344th Street, and between I-5 and 18th Place South.</li>
            <li>The site footprint is approximately 65 acres.</li>
            <li>The South 344th Street alternative would result in impacts to the built and natural environment (such as residential displacements, wetland and stream impacts) from the site and from connecting light rail tracks. The tracks would expect to be constructed for the TDLE light rail alignment regardless of whether this site is selected for the OMF.</li>
            <li>This site would include a test track. The test track would run parallel and on the east side of the connecting light rail tracks.</li>

          <h4>EIS comparison</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>This alternative would have the highest residential, business, employee, and community and social resource displacements.</li>
            <li>It would have the second-highest impacts to wetlands, forest land, and streams, which would require mitigation.</li>
            <li>
                In terms of amount of time to construct,

                its impacts would be similar to the preferred alternative

                <p>
                    We would need to construct 1.4-1.8 miles of additional track (also called “mainline” track) 
                    between the end of the Federal Way Link Extension (currently in construction) to the potential 
                    OMF sites in Federal Way—the preferred alternative at South 336th Street and the 
                    South 344th Street alternative—to transport light rail cars from the regional system to the OMF South. 
                    We’re also studying this track in the environmental review for the <a href="https://tdlink.participate.online/">Tacoma Dome Link Extension</a> as part of the route.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the Midway Landfill alternative is selected as the project to be built, these tracks in Federal Way will be built as part of TDLE.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Midway Landfill site is next to the Federal Way Link Extension route, 
                    so aside from short connecting tracks to the facility (also called “lead” tracks), 
                    there would be no added light rail track needed for that alternative.

            <ul>
              <li>
                The Midway Landfill alternative is in Kent, between South
                246th Street and South 252nd Street, and between I-5 and SR
                99.
              </li>
              <li>The site footprint is approximately 68 acres.</li>
              <li>
                Due to its location along the Federal Way Link Extension line,
                the Midway Landfill does not include connecting tracks.
              </li>
              <li>This site would not include a test track.</li>

            <h4>EIS comparison</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Midway Landfill alternative would take the longest to
                design and build, and it would be the most expensive to
                construct and operate. Depending on the construction option
                selected, it could result in more traffic congestion during
                site prep than other alternatives.
              </li>
              <li>
                The site would create the fewest residential, business, and
                employee displacements of the three site alternatives.
              </li>
              <li>
                It would result in no impacts to community and social
                resources, wetlands, forest land, or streams.

                <p>
                  Building on top of a landfill is a unique and complex
                  challenge. Sound Transit must address the likelihood that
                  this ground will continue shifting and settling over time,
                  which could affect the tracks, equipment and other
                  infrastructure. To prevent settlement, Sound Transit is
                  considering three methods to prepare the Midway Landfill
                  site for possible OMF construction: Platform, Hybrid and
                  Full Excavation. Due to contaminated material, material
                  removed from the Midway Landfill during construction would
                  require disposal at another landfill facility equipped to
                  accept contaminated waste. The material would be hauled by
                  truck to a regional transfer facility and sent on by rail
                  for disposal.

            <h3>Tips to guide your feedback</h3>
            <p>
              If you already submitted comments as part of the 2021 environmental review process, those comments are valid and you won’t need to resubmit them.  We welcome any comments that are new or different on the technical analysis in the Draft EIS! We’ll respond to substantive comments in the Final EIS. We welcome your opinion on which site(s) you like or dislike, and the Sound Transit Board will consider all comments as they work to confirm or modify the preferred alternative. 
            </p>
            <p>You can make any comment you would like but here are some examples to guide your feedback:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Questions or comments on the technical analysis in the Draft EIS for topics such as:</li>
              <ul class="mt-0">
                <li>transportation</li>
                <li>ecosystems</li>
                <li>hazardous material</li>
                <li>economic impacts</li>
                <li>noise and vibration</li>
                <li>property acquisitions and displacements</li>
                <li>visual resources</li>
              </ul>
              <li>What do you think about the possible impacts, benefits and mitigation for impacts our analysis identified for any of the three sites (preferred alternative, South 344th Street, Midway Landfill)?</li>
              <li>Should the Board confirm or modify the preferred alternative and why?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After the Draft EIS comment period is over, we’ll compile a summary of all the comments we received, and we’ll make it available on the Sound Transit website.</p>

            <p>
              After the Draft EIS comment period closes on Nov. 6, 2023, comments will be compiled and evaluated, and a summary of your comments will be provided to the Sound Transit Board in late 2023. Comments will be made available to the public at that time. The Final EIS, which will include responses to Draft EIS comments and evaluation of the preferred and other alternatives, is scheduled to be issued in mid-2024. After that, the Board will select a project to be built in mid to late 2024.
