            <p>
              We published a Draft EIS under the State Environmental Policy Act in 2021 that evaluated three possible
              sites for the OMF South facility. After a public comment period (<a
                href="https://www.soundtransit.org/sites/default/files/documents/operations-and-maintenance-facility-south-public-engagement-summary-20211110.pdf"
                target="_blank">engagement summary</a>,

                target="_blank">comment summary</a>), the Sound Transit Board identified the South 336th Street site in
              Federal Way as the preferred alternative in December 2021. To align federal and state processes, we are
              now publishing a National Environmental Policy Act Draft/SEPA Supplemental Draft EIS (Draft EIS) that
              evaluates these same alternatives. Based on its transit expertise and greater federal funding
              opportunities, the Federal Transit Administration will be the lead federal agency. A joint NEPA/SEPA Final EIS
              will follow in 2024.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                All public comments provided on the SEPA Draft EIS in 2021 are valid and do not need to be resubmitted.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will respond to all substantive comments from both comment periods in the Final EIS.
              </li>
              <li>
                After the Final EIS is published, the Sound Transit Board will select the project to be built.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Sound Transit is working toward an opening in 2032 but is also pursuing measures to advance the opening earlier (potentially 2030). If the Midway Landfill alternative is selected as the project to be built, the opening date would be between 2035 and 2037 depending on the subsurface construction design option. We
              will
              share an updated project schedule when we have more certainty.
            </p>
            <h4>
              What has changed since the SEPA Draft EIS was published in 2021?
            </h4>
            <p>
              We’ve continued the project’s design and engineering work since the 2021 publication of the SEPA Draft
              EIS. We’ve evaluated the potential environmental impacts of several design refinements, in the Draft EIS
              which include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>The addition of a test track and associated access road</b> to the proposed site layouts for South
                336th Street preferred alternative and South 344th Street alternatives. The test track would help us
                prepare new and existing light rail vehicles for service. The Midway Landfill alternative would not
                include a test track.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Updates to the South 336th Street preferred alternative site layout</b> in close coordination with
                the City of Federal Way.
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The main site entrance has been moved from SR 99 to South 340th Street.
                </li>
                <li>
                18th Place South has been extended to replace the functionality of 20th Avenue South. The 18th Place South extension would also include a multi-use path.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  The site has been expanded to the southwest to accommodate the 18th Place South extension and to provide more yard area space.
                </li>
                <li>
                  21st Avenue South has been extended to connect to South 344th Street.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Road widening has been incorporated on the south side of South 336th Street to meet city requirements.
                </li><li>
                  Existing culverts that convey the West Fork Hylebos Creek Tributary under South 336th Street and the East Fork Hylebos Creek Tributary under South 344th Street are planned to be removed and replaced with fish passable structures. 
                </li><li>
                  The site and internal track configuration has been modified to allow for a wider stream and wetland corridor on the east side of the OMF, between the site and I-5.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </ul>

                needs four strategically located OMF facilities. We need this new

                train fleet to support future light rail extensions to Tacoma and
                throughout the region. To build this new facility, we need

              <p>Voters approved 118 miles of Link light rail, including two new OMFs—one in the north corridor and
                another in the South Sound—to serve the growing light rail system.</p>
              <p><b>Mid to late 2018: Initial community idea gathering and evaluation</b></p>
              <p>After receiving community input during the early scoping outreach period in April 2018, Sound Transit
                identified 24 potential OMF South sites for further analysis. After initial screening, we reduced the
                number of potential sites to 20. We assessed these 20 sites with a robust list of evaluation criteria,
                including project schedule, long-term facility planning, operational requirements, environmental
                impacts, and engineering risks, among others. </p>
              <p><b>February to April 2019: SEPA Scoping</b></p>
              <p>Based on the results of the detailed screening, Sound Transit recommended six sites in Kent and Federal
                Way for further consideration. The public had the opportunity to share their thoughts on the six
                potential sites, as well as the OMF South project Purpose and Need Statement and environmental resources
                to evaluate in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement, during the scoping comment period under the
                State Environmental Policy Act.</p>
              <p><b>May 2019: Sound Transit Board action</b></p>
              <p>After reviewing community feedback gathered during scoping and the thorough evaluation on the the six
                potential sites, the Sound Transit Board identified three sites for further study in the Draft EIS:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Midway Landfill alternative</li>
                <li>South 336th Street alternative</li>
                <li>South 344th Street alternative</li>
              </ul>
              <p><b>Summer 2019 to 2021: SEPA Draft EIS</b></p>
              <p>Sound Transit prepared a Draft EIS under SEPA to share findings with tribes, agency and jurisdictional
                partners, social service and cultural organizations, and the public. We published the SEPA Draft EIS in
                2021 and held a public comment period (<a
                  href="https://www.soundtransit.org/sites/default/files/documents/operations-and-maintenance-facility-south-public-engagement-summary-20211110.pdf"

                  target="_blank">comment summary</a>).
              </p>
              <p><b>December 2021: Sound Transit Board identified a preferred alternative</b></p>
              <p>After the SEPA Draft EIS comment period, the Sound Transit Board considered the SEPA Draft EIS analysis
                and comments received and then identified the South 336th Street site in Federal Way as the preferred
                alternative, with all three sites still to be evaluated in a Final EIS.</p>
              <p><b>December 2021 to July 2023: Project refinements</b></p>
              <p>After the Sound Transit Board identified the South 336th Street site in Federal Way as the preferred
                alternative, we completed additional fieldwork activities and environmental analysis.
                Additional site refinements were made to the preferred and South 334th Street alternatives.</p>
              <p><b>July to August 2023: NEPA Scoping</b></p>
              <p>After the Federal Transit Administration became the lead agency for the OMF South project, both the
                Federal Transit Administration and Sound Transit held a scoping comment period under NEPA
                for comments in addition to those received during SEPA scoping.</p>
              <p><b>We are here: Draft EIS</b></p>
              <p>To align the federal and state processes, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and Sound Transit
                have
                published a NEPA Draft/SEPA Supplemental Draft EIS that evaluates the same three alternatives as the
                2021 SEPA Draft EIS. FTA is the lead
                agency under NEPA and Sound Transit is the lead agency under SEPA. This additional review is to support
                federal approvals, federal funding and assess project design changes. The findings from the EIS are
                being
                shared with Tribes, agency and jurisdictional partners, and the public through a 45-day public comment
                period. All public comments provided on the SEPA Draft EIS in 2021 remain valid and do not need to be
                resubmitted. After receiving and considering public comments, FTA and Sound Transit will complete a
                joint Final EIS before the Sound Transit Board selects the project to be built.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-5">What is an Environmental Impact Statement?</h3>

      <p>
        Before Sound Transit builds projects, we study the potential effects each project alternative may have on the
        natural and built environment in a document called an Environmental Impact Statement. The EIS helps decision
        makers, the public and our project partners evaluate the possible environmental impacts of each potential site
        during construction and operation. The EIS also compares the effects of each alternative to inform the public,
        agencies, and the Sound Transit Board.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the
        <a href="https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/documents-reports/operations-maintenance-facility-south-draft-environmental-impact"
          target="_blank">OMF South Draft EIS</a>, we looked at how the Midway Landfill, South 344th Street, and South
        336th Street alternatives would affect air and water quality, historical and cultural resources, property
        acquisition and land use, economic effects, hazardous materials, ecosystem resources, cost, schedule, and more.
        In December 2021, the Sound Transit Board identified the South 336th Street alternative as the preferred
        alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we’re combining our state (SEPA) and federal (NEPA) environmental review processes. We’ve published a Draft
        EIS that evaluates these same alternatives. A Final EIS will follow in 2024.
      </p>
      <h4>What potential environmental effects are different from the 2021 SEPA Draft EIS? </h4>
      <p>Since the 2021 SEPA Draft EIS, we've updated the analysis for all three alternatives. Here
        are some key updates.</p>
      <p><b>Increased residential displacements for Federal Way sites (preferred alternative and South 344th Street)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Since the 2021 SEPA Draft EIS publication, residential displacements have increased by 18-24 due to the
          advancement of design and construction information and the increased site size. The additional displacements
          are primarily along the northern portion of the guideway that connects the preferred and South 344th Street
          alternatives to the OMF site.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Other notable changes to potential effects from the preferred alternative</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The amount of long-term impacts to ecosystem resources, including streams, wetlands, and mature forest,
          decreased. However, the amount of long-term impacts to wetland buffers increased. These changes are due to
          refinements to the site design.</li>
        <li>Due to the site expansion, there was an increase in business and
          employee displacements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Other notable potential effects</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cost estimates have been updated to 2023 dollars and incorporate design refinements. Cost estimates are for comparative purposes and do not represent the project budget. The construction market in the Puget Sound region is affecting most infrastructure projects, so final construction costs may be higher than these comparative estimates. </li>
        <li>For the 344th Street alternative, business and employee displacements decreased due to shortening the tail
          track.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Why should I comment on the Draft EIS?</h4>
      <div style="background-color: #FFB819;" class="px-2">
        <p class="py-1"><b>All comments that were provided on the SEPA Draft EIS in 2021 remain valid and do not need to
            be resubmitted. We will respond to all substantive comments from both comment periods in the Final EIS.</b>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>During this Draft EIS comment
        period through Nov. 6, you can provide feedback on the alternatives, EIS analysis, and summary of scoping
        comments. SEPA Draft EIS comments from 2021 remain valid and do not need to be resubmitted; however, if you’d
        like to comment again,
        focus your comments on the project changes and updated analysis. After the comment period, we’ll then prepare a
        Final EIS, which will evaluate the
        preferred and other alternatives, and include responses to all substantive comments received on the Draft EIS.
        We expect to publish the Final EIS in 2024, then the Board will select the project to be built. Why comment?
        Comments from Tribes, the public, and agency partners inform the Board in their decision-making.</p>

          Did you receive a property owner letter or think the project may affect your property? A notification of

          possibility we would need to acquire your property in the future.

        <p>
          Final decisions on affected properties and acquisitions generally won’t occur until after the Final EIS and
          the Sound
          Transit Board selects the project to be built. In some limited cases, Sound Transit purchases properties prior
          to the Board's action. If we determine that your property is needed for OMF South, Sound Transit will initiate
          official
          conversations around acquisitions and relocation at that time and after an independent appraisal process.

              On Dec. 16, 2021, the Sound Transit Board identified the South
              336th Street alternative in Federal Way as the preferred alternative for OMF South.

            <ul>
              <li>
                The preferred alternative is in Federal Way, between South
                336th Street and South 341st Place, and between I-5 and SR 99.
              </li>
              <li>The site footprint is approximately 66 acres.</li>
              <li>
                The preferred alternative includes about 1.4 miles of

                  mainline
                  light rail tracks<sup>🛈</sup>

                light rail alignment.
              </li>
              <li>
                The preferred alternative also includes a test track to
                prepare new vehicles for service. The test track would run
                parallel and on the east side of the connecting light rail
                tracks.
              </li>

                <sup>🛈</sup>Why do the sites in Federal Way require light rail tracks?

              <div class="panel">
                <p>
                  We would need to construct 1.4-1.8 miles of additional track (also called “mainline” track)
                  between the end of the Federal Way Link Extension (currently in construction) to the potential
                  OMF sites in Federal Way—the preferred alternative at South 336th Street and the
                  South 344th Street alternative—to transport light rail cars from the regional system to the OMF South.
                  We’re also studying this track in the environmental review for the <a
                    href="https://tdlink.participate.online/">Tacoma Dome Link Extension</a> as part of the route.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the Midway Landfill alternative is selected as the project to be built, these tracks in Federal Way
                  would be built as part of TDLE.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Midway Landfill site is next to the Federal Way Link Extension route,
                  so aside from short connecting tracks to the facility (also called “lead” tracks),
                  there would be no added light rail track needed for that alternative.

                  Before a new light rail vehicle can start carrying passengers,
                  we need to test how it performs on the track.
                  Since we have light rail service running on the mainline track during most of the day,
                  we currently do all vehicle testing during the short service window from 1-5 a.m.
                  Building a test track will allow us to test vehicles more quickly to get them ready
                  for service—and we have a lot more cars coming online as we expand the regional light rail system!
                  After analyzing the most suitable location for a test track in our system,
                  we found that siting it near OMF South was the best fit technically and operationally.

                  between the end of the Federal Way Link Extension (currently in construction) to the potential
                  OMF sites in Federal Way—the preferred alternative at South 336th Street and the
                  South 344th Street alternative—to transport light rail cars from the regional system to the OMF South.
                  We’re also studying this track in the environmental review for the <a

                  The Midway Landfill site is next to the Federal Way Link Extension route,
                  so aside from short connecting tracks to the facility (also called “lead” tracks),
                  there would be no added light rail track needed for that alternative.

                  Building on top of a landfill is a unique and complex
                  challenge. Sound Transit must address the likelihood that
                  this ground will continue shifting and settling over time,
                  which could affect the tracks, equipment and other
                  infrastructure. To prevent settlement, Sound Transit is
                  considering three methods to prepare the Midway Landfill
                  site for possible OMF construction: Platform, Hybrid, and
                  Full Excavation. Due to contaminated material, material
                  removed from the Midway Landfill during construction would
                  require disposal at another landfill facility equipped to

                      <p class="sr-only">The Midway Landfill site alternative is located south of the future Kent and Des Moines station. The site’s boundaries include 244th Street to the north, I-5 to the east, South 252nd Street to the south, and State Route 99 to the west.

                        Current plans for the Midway Landfill alternative site include the existing stormwater pond at the northern end of the site. Landscaped areas are present in the north, south, and middle of the site. The OMF Building would be built in the central eastern portion of the site. The Link Storage Building would be located on the west side of the site, closer to State Route 99. Both buildings would have adjacent parking lots. The OMF yard and tracks take up the most space in the central areas of the site.
                        
                        The Federal Way Link Extension tracks will run along the eastern edge of the project site along I-5.

              After the NEPA Draft/SEPA Supplemental Draft EIS comment period closes on Nov. 6, 2023, comments will be
              compiled and evaluated, and a
              summary of your comments will be provided to the Sound Transit Board. Comments will be made
              available to the public at that time. The Final EIS, which will include responses to substantive Draft EIS comments and evaluation of the preferred and other alternatives, is anticipated to be issued. After that,
              the Board will select a project to be built in mid to late 2024, and the Federal Transit Administration is
              anticipated to issue a Record of Decision under NEPA.
